# SQL Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
This SQL challenge is designed to test and improve our skills in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis through a series of tasks. These tasks involve inspecting CSV files, creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), building table schemas, and running various SQL queries to analyze the data.

### Data Sources
The challenge utilizes six CSV files, which contain data related to a hypothetical company's employees, departments, and salaries.

### Tools Used
- **QuickDBD**: For sketching the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- **SQL**: For data engineering and analysis tasks.
- **Xpert Learning Assistant**: For additional guidance and hints.
- ** Class material examples.

## Part 1: Data Modeling
The first part of the challenge involved inspecting the provided CSV files to understand the relationships between data points. Based on this inspection, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was sketched using QuickDBD to visualize the data structure and relationships.

## Part 2: Data Engineering
This section focused on creating a table schema for each of the CSV files. The steps undertaken were as follows:
- Verification of primary keys to ensure uniqueness. Composite keys were created where necessary.
- Sequential creation of tables to accommodate foreign keys and maintain referential integrity.
- Specification of data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints for each table.

## Part 3: Data Analysis
Several SQL queries were executed to analyze the data, including:
1. Listing employee details such as number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. Identifying employees hired in 1986.
3. Listing managers for each department.
4. Showing department details for each employee.
5. Finding employees named Hercules with last names starting with 'B'.
6. Listing employees in the Sales department.
7. Listing employees in both Sales and Development departments.
8. Counting frequency of employee last names in descending order.


## Acknowledgements
This challenge was completed with reference to materials from our previous classwork exercises and hints from the Xpert Learning Assistant, which were invaluable for understanding complex SQL concepts and completing the challenge successfully.
